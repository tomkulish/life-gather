This is me playing with different technologies to see where I could make things I have to do in my day to day life easier. :-)



# Data Sources
1. Google Drive
Google APIs allow you to download items. My thought... O viewer.

Have python pull down "pictures" --> run them through a facial recogonition model --> if it finds one it thinks is O add it to a library. 

2. OwnTracks
Save off current location
I am thinking python pulls in the location from Mosquitto and saves it in MongoDB :-)
